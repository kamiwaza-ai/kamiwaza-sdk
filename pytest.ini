markers =
    unit: fast, deterministic tests that require no external services
    contract: schema/contract tests that rely on recorded HTTP interactions or OpenAPI fixtures
    integration: tests that exercise local dependencies such as Docker/MinIO (deselect with '-m "not integration"')
    live: tests that talk to a running Kamiwaza deployment via HTTPS
    e2e: full workflow tests that orchestrate multiple services end to end
    slow: intentionally slow tests (large downloads, perf probes)
    withoutresponses: tests that need real network access even when pytest-responses plugin is installed
