# Aikido Security Scanner Configuration
# ======================================
# Excludes only truly inert paths where no scan type (SAST, secrets, IaC, deps) is useful.
# The wheel includes only kamiwaza_sdk/ and kamiwaza_client/ packages, as defined by
# pyproject.toml [tool.setuptools.packages.find] include/exclude rules.
#
# Paths NOT excluded here (intentionally left scannable):
#   - .github/ (CI/CD — workflow security, secrets in pipelines)
#   - scripts/, release.sh, Makefile (supply chain — controls what ships in the wheel)
#   - setup.py, MANIFEST.in (build infrastructure — defines package contents)
#   - pyproject.toml, uv.lock (dependency manifests — vulnerability scanning)
#
# Use Aikido UI-based ignores for granular noise suppression on those paths.
# See: ENG-1815 for UI-based selective ignore configuration.
#
# Aikido path matching uses simple string inclusion — if the configured value appears
# anywhere in the full file path, it gets excluded. Wildcards/regex are not supported.
