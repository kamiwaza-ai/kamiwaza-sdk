# Aikido Security Scanner Configuration
# ======================================
# Excludes paths that are NOT part of the shipped product (the pip-installable wheel).
# The wheel includes only kamiwaza_sdk/ and kamiwaza_client/ packages, as defined by
# pyproject.toml [tool.setuptools.packages.find] include/exclude rules.
#
# Aikido path matching uses simple string inclusion — if the configured value appears
# anywhere in the full file path, it gets excluded. Wildcards/regex are not supported.
